Sandbox for BossyUI Directives
===

## To Start Development

To get started developing `cd` into the `sites/sandbox` directory.

```bash
cd sites/sandbox
```

Then run the `gulp serve` command to start up the development server.

```bash
gulp serve
```

Once the server is up and running visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. The served page will read-up all the directives current to bossy.all.js, and give you a list to pick from. Clicking on the edit button will display the directive to the right of the list where you can interact with your changes as you develop.
